# Pikachu_HCMUS
This is the project at HCMUS created by Tuan Kiet and Phuong Nam!
The basic algorithm is searching for valid pairs of boxes using orientation not the BFS algorithm.
- account files include codes about managing accounts and printing or writing their informations
- board files are main algorithms of the project.
- controller files help control the game on keyboard.
- game files determine how the game will be played(scores, times...)
- menu files play visual roles of the game.
